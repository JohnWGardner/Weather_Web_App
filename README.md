# Features

## 1. Home Page

- A weather search form using Bootstrap components, allowing users to input a city and retrieve weather data.
- A real-time display of current weather data, including temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed.
- A 5-day weather forecast, using Bootstrap cards, showing daily conditions, temperatures, humidity, and wind speeds.
- Fetching data dynamically from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Error handling with messages if the city is not found or if thereâ€™s an API issue.

## 2. Additional Features:

# UX/UI

## 1. Target Audience

- Users who want real-time weather data and a 5-day forecast for planning their daily or weekly activities.

## 2. User Stories

- As a user, I want to check the current weather in a specific city so that I can plan my day accordingly.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:** A search form with a clear input field for city name and a submit button.
  - A section that shows the city name, temperature, condition, and other relevant data after submission.

- As a user, I want to see a 5-day weather forecast to help plan my activities for the week.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The forecast should be displayed as cards with key weather info: temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: For layout, color schemes, and basic styles.
- **Bootstrap 4.6**: For responsive layout, styling, and form components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the dynamic weather display and API integration.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch real-time weather and forecast data.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment of the live app.

# API Integration

- The OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve real-time weather and 5-day forecast data based on user input.
- The app uses `fetch` to make asynchronous API calls, processes the JSON responses, and dynamically updates the DOM with weather data.

---

# Design Choices

## Color Scheme

- Warm color scheme used for forecast cards to enhance visual appeal.

## Fonts

- Standard fonts for readability and consistent design.
- Slightly larger, bold fonts for key weather information to improve visibility.

## Wireframes

- Wireframes were created to design the weather app layout:  
  `/workspace/Weather_Web_App/assets/wireframes`

# Testing

## HTML Validation

- Initial HTML validation was done using the W3C Markup Validation Service.

## CSS Validation

- CSS validation was performed using W3C's CSS Validator. http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link

## Accessibility

- Google Lighthouse audit reports an accessibility score of 87%, ensuring users with disabilities can access the site effectively.

## Browser and Device Testing

- Tested on multiple devices and browsers for responsiveness:
  - iPhone
  - Desktop
  - Chrome Developer Tools (simulating various devices)
  - Browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Safari
- Site functioned as expected across all tested platforms.
